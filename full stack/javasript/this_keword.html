<!-- // In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special identifier that refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value is determined at runtime, based on how the function is called, rather than where it is defined.
// Here's a breakdown of how this behaves in different scenarios:
// Global Context: Outside of any function or object, in the global scope, this refers to the global object. In browsers, this is typically the window object, while in Node.js, it's the global object.


// Object Methods: When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to the object itself.  -->
