//? In JavaScript, variables are used as containers to store data values. 
//? They are declared using the keywords let, const, or var, with let and const being the modern,
//?  recommended options. 



//! Three Type Variables


//? 1. Var 
//? 2. Let
//? 3. Const 



//! 1. Var 

//?The var keyword in JavaScript is used to declare a variable,
//?  which acts as a container for storing data values that can be changed during program executio 



//? ex: 

var r = "Rutvik"
var d = 100;
r = "Dolar"
console.log(r,d)





//! 2. Let

//? The let keyword in JavaScript is used to declare a variable that is block-scoped. 
//? This means the variable is only accessible within the specific block (enclosed in {}) 
//? where it is defined, in contrast to the older var keyword, which is function-scoped. 

//? ex: 


// let a = "raj"
// lat a = "dharmik"   //? Not used tu let variables 



let a = "raj"
a = "dharmik" 
console.log(a)




//! 3. Const 

//?  The const keyword in JavaScript is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after 
//?their initial value is set. It provides an "immutable binding" to a value, enhancing code reliability
//?  by preventing accidental changes to variable references. 


//? ex: 

const b = "het"

b = "raj"   //?   Not used tu Const variables 

// const b = "raj"   //?   Not used tu Const variables  and one time used tu const value 

console.log(b)
