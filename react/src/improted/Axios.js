// Axios is a promise-based HTTP library that helps you easily communicate with servers or
// APIs over the internet. It allows your website or app to send and receive data from a
// server, like fetching information, submitting forms, or updating content without reloading
// the entire page.

// Axios uses promises to handle HTTP requests and responses.


//Why Choose Axios over Fetch?

// . Easier syntax and cleaner code.

// . Automatic JSON transformation without extra code.

// . Better built-in error handling.

// . Support for older browser
