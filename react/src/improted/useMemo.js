// const memoizedValue = useMemo( () => { // Your computation logic here

// . useMemo is a React Hook used for memoization.

// . Memoization is a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive
// function calls.

// . Use it when you want to prevent unnecessary re-execution of a function on every render.

// . Useful for optimizing performance in situations where calculations or operations are
// computationally expensive.

// . Overusing useMemo might lead to unnecessary complexity and impact readability.
