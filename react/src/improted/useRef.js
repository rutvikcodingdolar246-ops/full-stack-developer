
//! useRef()

// . useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed for rendering.

// . Unlike states, it's directly mutable.

// . You can access value of it's using yourRef.current;


// Uncontrolled Components:

// . Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally and are typically
// refs.




// forwardRet()

// React forwardRef allows parent components to move down (or "forward")

// refs to their children. It gives a child component a reference to DOM entity
// created by its parent component in React. This helps the child to read and
// modify the element from any location where it is used.
